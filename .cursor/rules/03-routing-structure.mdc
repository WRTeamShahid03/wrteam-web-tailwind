# 🔀 Routing Structure

This project uses Next.js App Router for routing.

## 🧭 Key Routing Concepts
- Each folder in `src/app` represents a route segment
- Special files like `page.tsx`, `layout.tsx`, and `loading.tsx` define behavior
- Folder names in parentheses (e.g., `(blogsPages)`) are grouped routes that don't affect the URL path

## 🌐 Main Routes
- `/` - Homepage route [src/app/page.tsx](mdc:src/app/page.tsx)
- `/api` - API routes [src/app/api](mdc:src/app/api)
- `/services` - Services pages [src/app/services](mdc:src/app/services)
- `/our-work` - Portfolio/work showcase [src/app/our-work](mdc:src/app/our-work)
- `/hire-us` - Hire page [src/app/hire-us](mdc:src/app/hire-us)

## 📦 Route Groups
- `(pages)` - General pages
- `(productPages)` - Product-related pages
- `(portfolio)` - Portfolio items
- `(blogsPages)` - Blog posts and categories
- `(more)` - Additional pages

## 📌 Routing Conventions
- Use kebab-case for route folder names
- Create clean, descriptive URLs
- Place related routes in route groups (parentheses)
- Use dynamic routes when needed with [slug] naming convention
